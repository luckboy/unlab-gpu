## Introduction

The Unlab scripting language is a simple scripting language for GPU that operates on metrices. This
scripting language can be used to create and train neural networks. This tutorial can help you learn
this scripting language.

## Standard documentation

The standard documentation is a documentation for the standard library. This documentation isn't
generated while installation of the Unlab interpreter. If you have access to this documentation, you
should invoke the following command:

```
unlab-pkg std-doc
```

If your browser hasn't access to hidden files as Firefox from Ubuntu, you should change the
documentation path by add the following line to shell configuration (`.bashrc` for bash) before the
generation of standard documentation to browse this documentation:

```
export UNLAB_GPU_DOC_PATH=$HOME/unlab-gpu-doc
```
